## Stuff that we know that is currently broken and suggestions for fixing

### Type concatenate

### For
For seems to work with simple cases but we suspect that it won't work with more complex cases.

** add code which breaks for **

Suggestion is to add a new concept to handle for's 'control list' that is the ["i 1 2 3]. This would make it possible/easier to handle fors without step argument etc. Likely to require parsing rules, new Logotype, new node.

## Open brances

### Parsing-errors
